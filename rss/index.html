At this point, thoughts about one’s aspirations, passion and dreams go out of the window and landing any job sounds like a good option. The one thing we can do right now is to turn this setback into an opportunity and to indulge in the thought of what a luxury it would be to have a career that we have always envisioned. To think back in time and say —</p><blockquote><em><em>“Oh losing my job was such a blessing in disguise! I am now, in a much better place than what I was in back then.”</em></em></blockquote><p>This article lists down the steps one can take today, no matter what their situation looks like to build a future that they would be proud of. There are 5 steps to start working towards a change —</p><h1 id="step-1-beginning-to-listen-to-ourselves"><strong>Step 1: Beginning to Listen to Ourselves</strong></h1><p>The one thing anxiety brings along with itself is uncertainty and lesser confidence in ourselves. We’d think every decision we take would now have to be validated by someone who has their life sorted.</p><ul><li>When we don’t have a strong opinion and our mind blanks, our surroundings (family, relatives, friends, strangers on TV, the Internet) starts making them for us and that is when we start losing control. Even if its simple decisions we always look towards someone or something that can validate our decisions for us.</li><li>The majority of people out there are telling us what to do. A common train of thought goes like —</li></ul><blockquote><em><em>“I know a guy who underperformed and lost his job, but went on to getting higher studies in XYZ college and now, he earns six figures.”</em></em></blockquote><ul><li>This is when we start thinking that even though studying at XYZ doesn’t seem like something we’d want to do, we still end up doing it because some guy earns six figures now. The sheer amount of peer and financial pressure we would get when unemployed is enough to bend our minds into doing something that doesn’t intrinsically speak to us.</li><li>The one thing we can start doing immediately is to stop blaming ourselves for what has already happened and most importantly, <strong><strong>stop letting the world decide what we should do. </strong></strong>Our anxieties and thoughts are important. They are our body trying to tell about the path we should take. We should be the one controlling our destiny and nobody else.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1471958680802-1345a694ba6d?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHJvYWR8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="5 Steps to finding employment" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1471958680802-1345a694ba6d?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHJvYWR8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1471958680802-1345a694ba6d?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHJvYWR8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1471958680802-1345a694ba6d?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHJvYWR8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1471958680802-1345a694ba6d?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHJvYWR8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@foxxmd?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Matt Duncan</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h1 id="step-2-owning-our-fate">Step 2: Owning our Fate</h1><ul><li>We can either blame existing circumstances on the pandemic, our previous employment being unfair, the stars not being aligned properly or we can begin by taking ownership. That is the only way we can start<strong><strong> looking at the problem at hand more objectively.</strong></strong></li><li>Just like getting an award for great performance is 100% our responsibility, facing a hardship in life is also 100% our responsibility. It is our responsibility <strong><strong>nobody is tasked with the job to pull us out of our mess.</strong></strong></li></ul><h2 id="step-3-resolving-urgencies-if-any-"><br>Step 3: Resolving Urgencies (if any)</h2><p>We are faced with various kinds of situations that the unemployment might have brought us.</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Let us take note of the situation we are in </strong></strong>and rate how urgently money is required from a scale of 1 to 5. Where 1 is having enough financial support and 5 is where money is needed in the next few days.</li><li>Ranking ourselves with 1 does not mean that it’s okay to slack off now. Getting employment is still a very urgent matter.</li><li>If the rank is a 4 or 5, there are a few things that can get us a temporary source of money so that we can have<strong><strong> some headspace to think about the next few steps. </strong></strong>Some examples are</li></ul><ol><li>Renting out the parking space or the second bedroom.</li></ol><p>2.

The idea is to take full inventory of everything we own and engineering a recipe out of it.</li><li>I am a visual designer, so my skills could be — Illustration, graphic design knowledge, motion design. For a restaurant owner the skills could be — cooking, people management, book-keeping, budgeting, customer service etc. For a software engineers — data structures, algorithms, python programming and so on.</li><li>Next we have to rate ourselves on a scale of 1 to 5 and <strong><strong>identify the rotten tomatoes in our recipe.</strong></strong> Let’s say I rate my motion design skills as 2 on 5 and that’s one rotten tomato I have to include in my recipe.</li><li>Now, let’s say we rate one of our skills, say — data structures a 4 out of 5. We want to test our knowledge by opening up a website and <strong><strong>see if we actually stand true to our assessment. </strong></strong><em><em>(We have this innate ability to lie to ourselves and that is the last thing we need)</em></em></li></ul><p>Now that we have a list of all ingredients, it’s time to engineer a recipe. It’s okay if we have a lot of rotten tomatoes, we need to own our fate here<em><em> (see step 2)</em></em>. Let us take our top rated skills and google ways to present them online.</p><ul><li>For example, if you are restaurant owner, google ways of how people are showing their work online — maybe do a YouTube video of that pasta dish your customers loved. You can tell people how you miss them eating your food and how safe and clean your restaurant is for them.</li><li>If you are a software engineer — make a video or write an article about a very difficult problem that you were able to solve. Tell the people out there you know how to solve this problem and even tougher ones.</li></ul><blockquote>A resume in this day and age, is not confined to paper. It is your online presence that recruiters would be most attracted to.</blockquote><ul><li>We need to take whatever ingredients we have to make a recipe for creating a stamp on the online world. <strong><strong>The pandemic is a blessing in disguise because people are spending time online more than ever </strong></strong>on so many platforms that we can start taking advantage of now!</li><li>The next time, when the need arises for a new skill — do a small crash course and post whatever notes you took on social media and that could be one of the stamps. It shows you are spending time learning things that matter.<strong><strong> In this way we are using not just fresh vegetables in the recipe but also the rotten tomatoes</strong></strong></li><li>Not only will we have improved but we would also have created a considerable dent in whatever area we want to establish ourself in. This is where the magic starts to happen. <strong><strong>There will be a plethora of work just waiting online as proof </strong></strong>that testifies for whatever position we are looking for.</li></ul><h1 id="step-5-keeping-track-of-our-progress">Step 5: Keeping Track of our Progress</h1><p>Whatever steps we will take for making this recipe, the only way to keep it all together and well balanced is to keep track of what we have done, what we are still left to do with, what’s coming in the future and how we are performing overall.</p><p>Creating a Kanban board with 4 columns — In Progress, Done, Backlog and Might Do helps.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/02/1_uuz2-smxU1DbUpZurD5uww.png" class="kg-image" alt="5 Steps to finding employment" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/1_uuz2-smxU1DbUpZurD5uww.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/1_uuz2-smxU1DbUpZurD5uww.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/02/1_uuz2-smxU1DbUpZurD5uww.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An example Kanban board from my Notion — you can<a href="https://www.notion.so/" rel="noopener nofollow"> sign up for notion too</a> for a free account</figcaption></figure><p>Along with this <strong><strong>maintain a journal </strong></strong>to track what steps that you took today to engineer your recipe with the ingredients that you have. Also write what you will be doing tomorrow, the next month and so on.</p><p>To take an example of this entire process of keeping track —</p><ul><li>Let’s say I understand that my motion design skills suck <em><em>(rotten tomato)</em></em>.</li><li>I would write on my Kanban’s might do list — “sign up for an hour long crash course and put up my learnings from that online” and “Do a small project of my own and put it up online by so and so date”</li><li>I would then later start taking that course and understand that it’s taking me more than an hour to grasp the concepts, so I would put the other task in the backlog and focus on learning the skill better. I would also share whatever I have learnt online by writing an article.</li><li>The next day I would check my progress again, write down problems I am facing with learning — could be my laziness, that idiot friend who keeps telling me I am a nerd for studying so much or being swamped with office work.</li><li>I would then think ways to get less lazy, ask that “cool” friend of mine to lay off for sometime, block an hour of time on my calendar for personal work during office hours.</li></ul><p>Rinse and repeat the next day</p><p>All these things being written might seem like great knowledge but remember that they will only help out if we turn them into wisdom. <strong><strong>Start small today and take your favourite bit of this article for showing it online. </strong></strong>Tell people you learnt something about being more productive and start making your dent.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I got the mindset of a monk, to become a super learner]]></title><description><![CDATA[Remember that feeling you get when you’re stuck in traffic and you know that you will be missing your flight?

What happens?</p><p>As human beings, we get used to any sort of discomfort over a certain period of time and <strong><strong>go on autopilot for however long we need to be. </strong></strong>Isn’t that why it takes a <strong><strong><em><em>fist to our face </em></em></strong></strong>(metaphorical of course) to make us realize that enough is enough?</p><p>I felt the same working as a software engineer at one of the top companies in India for the last one year. Over time, I got too comfortable until one day I looked around and I realized that most people around me <strong><strong>were living life on autopilot,</strong></strong> and would happily retire doing the same work all their lives. Design for me was a way to think bigger and connect with the world at large, so I decided to become a Designer.</p><p>It was easier said than done. All my applications would be rejected because of a lack of formal design qualifications. I was about to give up when I received a call from a design studio — <strong><strong>UXReactor.</strong></strong> They were hiring for Visual Designers and they liked my portfolio.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://uxreactor.com/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">UXReactor - Strategic Partner In Designing eXperiences</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">UXReactor is a design partner who uses Pragmatic UX design for both products and organizations, integrating design, user studies, and strategy.

I caught a fish, now I just have to deploy all my buzzwords and charm to bring it in. In one of the interview rounds, I was asked to work on an assignment that would later be judged by a panel from their design team.</p><p>They saw right through me and pointed out the flaws in my assignment — right and left.</p><p>One would think I’d be shattered with such criticism but that to me was yet another fist on the face, except this time it made me happy. For the first time in a year, <strong><strong>I knew what to do to become a Designer<em><em>.</em></em></strong></strong> Instinctively, I started daydreaming about all the possible scenarios of me becoming the next top Designer.</p><p>After this, I got several other job offers and you could think of what that would have done to my <strong><strong>ego — it became inflated. </strong></strong>I was about to sign up for some organisation which offered me a great package and position when I got another call -</p><p><em><em>“Hello, we are glad to inform you that we have decided to go ahead with your application to UXReactor and would want you to come to visit our office sometime.”</em></em></p><p>That totally threw me off. I knew somewhere deep inside that the folks in the other company had no clue about Design but the <strong><strong>guys at UXReactor ‘recognized’ </strong></strong>my flaws and still wanted me to come on board. That made all the difference. I didn’t think twice afterward and packed my bags.</p><p>Mind you, I was carrying heavy baggage into my new office which included — an inflated bag full of ego, a suitcase filled with bad design practices, a bucket load of fake confidence, and of course all of it was accompanied by pouches of denial.</p><p>Remember that fist on the face I was talking about before? That was a feather compared to the punches I landed in the next two months after my training started. <strong><strong>My ego, confidence, self -worth, and pride were beaten black and blue.</strong></strong></p><p>I was assigned a mentor who was to give me tasks, monitor my progress, and help me grow. I learned more from my mentor compared to the tasks he’d give me. <strong><strong>The way he would treat his work was with immense pride not towards himself but for the organization itself.</strong></strong></p><p>For him, a <strong><strong>client call and teaching me typography was of equal importance. </strong></strong>Unfortunately, I couldn’t look past my fat ego.</p><p>All throughout the tasks that I was given, <strong><strong>I would fail to deliver on time or deliver quality. </strong></strong>The first thoughts that would come to my mind was that of my ego’s — <em><em>“It is not your fault! Your mentor didn’t train you enough.”, “Your timelines were actually unrealistic”, “This place is way too harsh on you, they are all inhuman”,” What would everyone think about me now?”</em></em></p><p>After this happened a few times, I said — enough. Except this time not to an external situation but internal. I wanted to leave ego and move on to modesty.</p><p>The next day, I went in without my baggage. I apologised to everyone, put my head down and went straight to work. Everybody was surprisingly understanding and said that it’s okay to fail as long as I don’t <strong><strong>repeat the same mistakes again.</strong></strong></p><p>I thought that the day I pass I’d be so happy but on the contrary, I was not affected by the results and wanted to work on something else because <strong><strong>every experience in the UXReactor training taught me a valuable lesson.</strong></strong> In the end, it wasn’t about passing or failing. It was not even about winning a fight. This was a mandatory cleanse that I feel everyone must undergo at one point in their life.</p><hr><p>The key takeaways from this experience would be:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Humility and modesty</strong></strong> are important skills to develop. Nobody wants to work with a loud peacock.</li><li>Absolutely nothing changes without <strong><strong>consistent efforts and discipline</strong></strong>. We should learn from every experience and strive to tweak what is not working. This should not just be a 9–5 practice, instead, it should be a 24/7 process.</li><li><strong><strong>Self-awareness</strong></strong> is key to become a super learner. Being brutally honest with yourself and confronting the uncomfortable truths is the only way for a learner.</li><li><strong><strong>Focus on the long term. </strong></strong>Short term thinking will get you a job, not a career. Create an ecosystem of people with similar thoughts.</li><li>Most importantly, <strong><strong>have faith in yourself and hope for a better future</strong>.</strong></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>Sidenote to my mentors and peers:<br>
I would owe a large chunk of any success I achieve to you. Within just two months here, I have not only learnt design but something more — becoming a better human being. That is going to go a long way. Any amount of gratitude is less for the noble work we are doing here at UXReactor.</p>
